In order to use this app, please make sure you have NodeJS installed and MongoDB works in your local machine. After you are done installing the previous two things, please do the following steps:

1. Make sure that you puled the latest code from the "main" branch in the GitHub repo.
2. Make sure that your MongoDB server is up and running. You can use MongoDBCompass as a tool to run your server. Also, make sure that your server is running exactly on "mongodb://localhost:27017".
3. In the terminal type "npm install" or "npm i" to install all the dependencies in the package.json. If npm gives you an error, it could be that NodeJS was not installed properly.
4. Run "seed.js", located in the tasks folder. "npm run seed" can be used in the terminal to run the seed file to pre populate the website.
5. After installing all the dependencies, in the terminal type "npm start" to start the application. It will be running locally on "http://localhost:3000".
6. Enjoy!!
